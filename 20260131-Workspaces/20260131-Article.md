# ProjectWise Managed Workspaces  
*(or: how to make CAD standards boring, predictable, and correct)*

## TL;DR — Executive Summary

**ProjectWise Managed Workspaces are a quality control mechanism.**

They allow an administrator to centrally define and deploy a **single, consistent CAD standards configuration** to all users on a project, with **no local workspace setup required by the user**.

Workspace files are stored in ProjectWise, copied locally by the client, and **kept in sync automatically**. Configuration changes are deployed centrally and applied consistently across the project.

This ensures:
- Every deliverable starts from the same standards  
- Configuration is compliant, repeatable, and auditable  
- Changes are applied consistently without user intervention  

The **Dynamic Managed Workspace Framework (DMWF)** builds on this by providing a templated, `.cfg`-based approach that reduces duplication, simplifies debugging, and supports multiple products and clients.

When combined with **ProjectWise Drive**, local workspace deployment becomes more efficient, startup and file open times improve, and issues caused by stale or missing files are significantly reduced.

**This is not about convenience.**  
It’s about **reliability, consistency, and enforceable CAD standards**.

*Next time, I’ll look at how the same quality-control problem is addressed on the AutoCAD side, using Workspace Profiles to enforce centralised CAD standards across AutoCAD and its verticals.*

## TL;DR — Technical Summary

- A **Workspace** is CAD standards configuration, not a project container  
- **ProjectWise Managed Workspaces** store workspace files in the ProjectWise datasource and deploy them via a **client-side copy-out process**  
- Configuration is applied using **Configuration Settings Blocks (CSBs)** stored in the datasource  
- CSBs can be associated to multiple ProjectWise objects and are applied by **defined scope and precedence**  
- Managed Workspaces:
  - Require the ProjectWise Explorer client  
  - Resolve variables to ProjectWise locations  
  - Copy workspace files to local `dms` folders  
  - Track and record copy-out operations  
- **DMWF** replaces large numbers of CSBs with a structured, text-based `.cfg` framework and PWSetup control files  
- DMWF supports:
  - Workspace templating  
  - Dynamic variable resolution  
  - Workspace grouping for multiple clients  
  - Path validation and version detection  
- When paired with **ProjectWise Drive**:
  - Workspace files are synchronised locally  
  - Only delta changes are copied after the initial deployment  
  - Deleted files are removed cleanly  
  - New files propagate predictably  

Net result: fewer configuration variants, fewer assumptions, and fewer unexplained behaviours.

## Why Management Should Care

This is not a CAD preference discussion.

It is a **risk, quality, and governance** discussion.

ProjectWise Managed Workspaces provide:
- A controlled and auditable mechanism for deploying CAD standards  
- Assurance that deliverables are created using an approved configuration  
- Reduced reliance on individual users maintaining local environments  
- Lower rework caused by inconsistent standards application  

Because ProjectWise:
- Records workspace copy-outs  
- Applies configuration centrally  
- Controls update propagation  

You can demonstrate *what configuration was in effect* when work was created.

That turns standards from guidance into enforcement.

---

## The Longer Version (For People Who Have to Build This)

If you’ve ever “created a new workspace” by copying an old one, renaming a folder, and changing paths until the errors stopped—this will sound familiar.

It probably worked.  
It probably still works.  
Nobody can prove *why* it works.

That’s not reassurance. That’s technical debt.

**ProjectWise Managed Workspaces** replace that uncertainty with a defined process.

---

## What a Workspace Actually Is

A **Workspace** is not a project.

A **Workspace** is a **CAD standards configuration**.

It defines:
- Workspace root location  
- Standards, cells, levels, seed files, and resources  
- Where WorkSets are rooted (if used)  

It is configuration only.

ProjectWise does not change this definition — it manages how that configuration is delivered.

---

## What ProjectWise Managed Workspaces Actually Do

ProjectWise Managed Workspaces:
- Store workspace files in the ProjectWise datasource  
- Apply configuration through **Configuration Settings Blocks (CSBs)**  
- Copy required files to the user’s local `dms` workspace  
- Track and verify copy-outs  

The copy-out process:
- Downloads all referenced workspace files on first use  
- Verifies configuration on subsequent launches  
- Downloads only delta changes after updates  

This gives you a centrally controlled workspace that behaves like a local one.

---

## Configuration Settings Blocks (CSBs)

CSBs contain configuration logic stored in the datasource and can be applied to:
- Datasources  
- Applications  
- Folders and Work Areas  
- User groups and users  

They are evaluated by **defined configuration levels and load precedence**, not guesswork.

This is how consistency is enforced.

---

## What DMWF Is (And What It Is Not)

**DMWF is not a feature you turn on.**

It is a **templated managed workspace framework** that:
- Uses text-based `.cfg` files instead of large numbers of CSBs  
- Introduces PWSetup control files to determine which workspace loads  
- Supports dynamic resolution based on environment, product, and context  

According to Bentley’s own training material, DMWF:
- Saves setup time  
- Simplifies debugging  
- Enables “one configuration” across multiple products and clients  

If your managed workspace is difficult to reason about, DMWF is usually what’s missing.

## ProjectWise Drive and Reliability

The workbook is explicit about one thing:  
Managed Workspaces **copy files locally**.

ProjectWise Drive complements this by:
- Providing a synchronised local working copy  
- Ensuring deleted files are removed  
- Ensuring new files are available everywhere  
- Reducing unnecessary network dependency  

This reduces startup delays, file open issues, and “it works on my machine” problems.

---

## Final Thought

ProjectWise Managed Workspaces are not about convenience.  
DMWF is not about clever configuration.

They are about **reliability**.

They ensure:
- Configuration is applied the same way, every time  
- Standards are enforced, not requested  
- Behaviour can be verified, audited, and explained  

That is quality control, implemented technically.

## What’s Next

Next time, I’ll look at **how Workspace Profiles can be used to enforce centralised CAD standards with AutoCAD and its verticals**—and how the same quality-control principles apply, even when the tooling is different.

Different platform.  
Same problem.  
Same expectation: predictable, compliant outcomes.
