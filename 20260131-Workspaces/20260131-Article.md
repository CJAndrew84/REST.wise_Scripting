# ProjectWise Managed Workspaces  
*(or: how to make CAD standards boring, predictable, and correct)*

## TL;DR — Executive Summary

**ProjectWise Managed Workspaces are a quality control mechanism.**

They allow an administrator to deploy a **single, consistent CAD standards configuration** to all users on a project, **centrally and automatically**, without relying on local copies, shared drives, or user action.

This ensures:
- Every deliverable starts from the same standards  
- Configuration is compliant, repeatable, and auditable  
- Changes are applied consistently across the project  

The **Dynamic Managed Workspace Framework (DMWF)** makes this scalable by structuring configuration so it can be reused and maintained without duplication.

When combined with **ProjectWise Drive**, deployment and updates are faster, startup and file open times improve, and “mysterious” behaviour caused by stale or mismatched files is significantly reduced.

**This is not about convenience.**  
It’s about **reliability, consistency, and enforceable CAD standards**.

*Next time, I’ll look at how the same quality-control problem is solved on the AutoCAD side, using Workspace Profiles to enforce centralised CAD standards across AutoCAD and its verticals.*

## TL;DR — Technical Summary

- A **Workspace** is CAD standards configuration, not a project container  
- **ProjectWise Managed Workspaces** store MicroStation/OpenRoads configuration as centrally managed **Configuration Settings Blocks (CSBs)**  
- CSBs are applied by scope and priority, ensuring all users receive the same configuration without local setup  
- **DMWF** provides a structured, `.cfg`-based include framework so configuration is:
  - Reusable  
  - Predictable  
  - Maintainable  
- DMWF reduces configuration duplication and exception sprawl  
- When paired with **ProjectWise Drive**:
  - Configuration resolves against a consistent local working copy  
  - Deployment and updates are faster  
  - File open and startup times improve  
  - Deleted and added files are handled cleanly  

Net result: fewer variables, fewer assumptions, and fewer unexplained behaviours.

## Why Management Should Care

This is not a CAD preference discussion.

It’s a **risk and quality** discussion.

ProjectWise Managed Workspaces provide:
- A controlled, auditable method for deploying CAD standards  
- Confidence that deliverables are created from an approved configuration  
- Reduced reliance on individual users “doing the right thing”  
- Fewer rework cycles caused by inconsistent environments  

When configuration is centrally managed:
- Standards compliance is enforceable, not advisory  
- Onboarding and offboarding are safer and faster  
- Support effort drops because environments are predictable  
- Issues can be investigated with evidence, not assumptions  

In short:
- Less avoidable rework  
- Less exposure to non-compliant deliverables  
- More confidence that “the standards” actually mean something  

This is governance, implemented technically—without adding process overhead.

## The Longer Version (For People Who Have to Build This)

If you’ve ever “created a new workspace” by copying an old one, renaming a folder, and changing paths until the errors stopped—this will sound familiar.

It probably worked.  
It probably still works.  
Nobody can prove *why* it works.

That’s not a comfort. That’s a liability.

**ProjectWise Managed Workspaces** exist to remove that uncertainty—not by training, not by policy documents, but by enforcement.

---

## What a Workspace Actually Is

A **Workspace** is not a project.

A **Workspace** is a **CAD standards configuration**.

In Bentley terms, it defines:
- Where your workspace root lives  
- Where standards, cells, levels, seed files, etc. are sourced from  
- Where WorkSets are rooted (if you use them)  

That’s it.

It’s configuration.  
Not data.  
Not deliverables.  
Not a ProjectWise folder structure.

Most confusion starts when this distinction gets lost.

---

## What ProjectWise Managed Workspaces Actually Do

ProjectWise does not redefine what a Workspace is.

What it does is manage the **configuration that drives the Workspace**.

With **ProjectWise Managed Workspaces**, configuration variables and values are stored centrally in the datasource as **Configuration Settings Blocks (CSBs)**.

In practical terms, this allows an administrator to:
- Apply a **consistent configuration** to all deliverables on a project  
- Deploy that configuration to **all users on the project**  
- Do it **without user intervention**  

No linking to server locations.  
No copying workspaces locally.  
No “did you update your standards?” emails.

The configuration lives in ProjectWise.  
ProjectWise applies it.

Everyone starts on the same hymn sheet—whether they were paying attention or not.

---

## This Is About Quality Control

Managed Workspaces are often described as a convenience feature.

They aren’t.

They are a **quality control mechanism**.

They give you:
- A compliant way to deploy CAD standards  
- A consistent configuration across all deliverables  
- A way to prove what configuration was in effect at the time work was created  

When standards are centrally managed:
- You don’t argue about whose workspace was wrong  
- You don’t guess which version someone had  
- You can actually audit outcomes  

Consistency stops being aspirational and becomes enforceable.

## What DMWF Is (And What It Is Not)

**DMWF is not a product.**  
There is no checkbox. There is no installer.

DMWF is a **framework and pattern** for structuring managed configuration so it remains understandable and maintainable over time.

It’s based on:
- A defined set of `.cfg` files  
- A predictable include chain  
- Variables that resolve based on context, not duplication  

The intent is deliberately boring:
- Define standards once  
- Reuse them everywhere  
- Override only what genuinely needs to differ  

If your managed workspace setup feels clever, DMWF is probably missing.

---

## Managed Workspaces vs DMWF (Why This Gets Confused)

These solve different problems at different layers.

- **Managed Workspaces** answer:  
  *Where is configuration stored, and how is it deployed?*

- **DMWF** answers:  
  *How do I avoid rebuilding the same configuration for every project?*

You can use Managed Workspaces without DMWF.

You’ll just recreate most of DMWF accidentally, one exception at a time.

---

## A Necessary Aside: Work Areas (Not Workspaces)

A **ProjectWise Work Area** is a project container.

It is **not** a Workspace.

It matters here only because some ProjectWise macros used in managed configuration resolve differently depending on whether a file is associated with a Work Area.

That affects how configuration resolves.  
It does not redefine what a Workspace is.

Keeping those concepts separate avoids a lot of unnecessary confusion.

---

## Where DMWF and ProjectWise Drive Pay Off

One of the quieter benefits of DMWF is how well it works with **ProjectWise Drive**.

DMWF assumes a structured, predictable file set.  
ProjectWise Drive provides a consistent local working copy of that set.

Together, they:
- Make deployment faster  
- Make updates smaller and cleaner  
- Improve startup and file open times  
- Reduce reliance on live network paths  

More importantly, they reduce *weird behaviour*.

---

## Fewer Ghosts in the Machine

A lot of unexplained CAD issues come from:
- Deleted files that are still referenced  
- New files that haven’t propagated everywhere  
- Users working against slightly different folder states  

With DMWF and ProjectWise Drive:
- Configuration resolves against a known local structure  
- Files appear and disappear cleanly  
- Everyone sees the same thing, at the same time  

When a file is removed, it’s gone.  
When a file is added, everyone gets it.

No half-updated workspaces.  
No phantom paths.  
No folklore.

## How I Troubleshoot This (Briefly)

When someone says *“the workspace didn’t load”*, that’s not a diagnosis.

So I verify:
- Using PowerShell  
- Using ProjectWise REST (WSG) APIs  
- Using SQL  

The questions are always the same:
1. What does ProjectWise think this object is?  
2. What configuration should apply?  
3. Where do those disagree?  

Once you know that, the fix is usually unremarkable.

---

## Final Thought

ProjectWise Managed Workspaces are not about convenience.  
DMWF is not about clever configuration.

They are about **reliability**.

They ensure:
- Every deliverable starts from the same standards  
- Every user gets the same configuration  
- Changes are deployed centrally and predictably  
- Behaviour can be explained, audited, and repeated  

That’s quality control.

Not training.  
Not hope.  
Not “please remember to update your workspace.”

If standards matter, they need to be enforced by the system—not by good intentions.

The companion video shows exactly how to do that, and how to prove it when someone asks.

## What’s Next

Next time, I’ll look at **how Workspace Profiles can be used to enforce centralised CAD standards with AutoCAD and its verticals**—and how the same quality-control principles apply, even when the tooling is very different.

Different platform.  
Same problem.  
Same expectation: predictable, compliant outcomes.
