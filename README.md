# {REST:wise} Scripting
## Scripting ProjectWise and other systems RESTfully

No Fluff. No “Hello World.” Just Real Solutions.

This repo is for anyone who’s:

Stared blankly at WSG’s empty JSON responses
Fought PowerShell’s curly brace escaping (and lost, then won, then lost again)
Watched a working script break because a document version changed
If that’s you — welcome. You’ve found the right corner of the internet.

### Why This Exists

Inspired by Brian M. Flaherty, Dave Brumbaugh, P.E., and the ProjectWise PowerShell Blog — but built from my own day-to-day battles with ProjectWise, PowerShell, and Bentley’s iTwin APIs. I’m here to share the scripts, tools, and “wish I’d known this sooner” moments that actually help you get real work done.

### What You’ll Find Here

PowerShell snippets that actually run in production
Power Automate tips that save hours of clicking
Postman collections for reverse-engineering undocumented APIs
Complete scripts, walkthroughs, and logic explanations
Real-world automation insights for ProjectWise and iTwin

### TL;DR

This repo is your source for real-world scripting and automation for ProjectWise and Bentley APIs — using PowerShell, Power Platform, and REST APIs. No nonsense, just solutions that work.
