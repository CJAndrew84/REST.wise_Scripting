# CDE vs EDMS – They’re Not the Same Thing (And Yes, It Matters)

I’ve seen a lot of posts on LinkedIn lately about *CDE this* and *CDE that* — and honestly, a fair few of them read like they were generated by an AI chatbot for someone who’s never actually worked in one.
It’s all very polished, very confident… and in some cases, very wrong.

More recently, I was asked if I could help explain what a CDE is and provide some training for a team that was struggling with the concept. I couldn’t take that on directly, but it struck me that the challenge isn’t unique — a lot of people in our industry are still unclear on what a CDE actually is, how it differs from an EDMS, and when each should be used.

So I thought I’d do the next best thing: write this article to share my thoughts and experience — hopefully offering some clarity, guidance, and maybe a reality check or two.

### TL;DR / Executive Summary
- All CDEs are EDMSs — but not all EDMSs are CDEs  
- A true CDE must follow ISO 19650 principles: information states, controlled workflows, metadata, and access tied to state  
- ProjectWise, Aconex, and Viewpoint/4Projects are CDE-capable — but only when configured correctly  
- ACC/BIM 360 and Trimble Connect can simulate/partially support CDEs, but lack true state-based controls  
- SharePoint, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box = EDMS only  
- UI/UX matters — a perfect CDE nobody likes using will be bypassed, while a user-friendly EDMS might be used properly every day  
- Choose EDMS when compliance isn’t critical; choose a configured CDE when scale, risk, or contracts demand it

### My Story
I’ve spent 25 years in the construction industry, and the last 15 of those working with ProjectWise.

I started out as a Trainee Draftsman in a small surveying, architecture, and civil engineering business in my hometown. For those first eight years, I did a bit of everything — building surveys, boundary disputes, topo surveys, planning applications, building regs drawings, through to highways and drainage design for residential developments and small energy projects.

From there, I moved into the Highways Design Department of a consultancy, first as a CAD Technician, then becoming an Engineer and eventually stepping into the world of Digital Engineering and Information Management.

That journey has exposed me to a huge variety of systems, processes, people, and ways of working — from small, local projects to large-scale infrastructure programmes.

Over that time, I’ve seen:
- True CDEs doing exactly what ISO 19650 intended  
- EDMSs pretending to be CDEs with clever folder gymnastics  
- And “solutions” that were just shiny shared drives in disguise  

This isn’t theory — it’s from the trenches. And yes, I’m very much in the PW camp.

### What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

**Bentley ProjectWise**  
- Status: True CDE (when configured)  
- Strengths: State workflows; metadata-driven access; robust audit trail  
- Weaknesses: Without ISO configuration it’s just a high-end EDMS  
- Scores: Capability 10.0 | UX 4 | Practical Effectiveness 7.6  
- Best used for: Complex infra projects; lifecycle traceability; integrates with engineering tools; often paired with SharePoint/OneDrive for co-authoring documents.  

**Aconex**  
- Status: True CDE (when configured)  
- Strengths: Workflow-driven state changes; role-based access; compliance reporting  
- Weaknesses: Without config, workflows risk becoming glorified transmittals  
- Scores: Capability 10.0 | UX 5 | Practical Effectiveness 8.0  
- Best used for: Contract-heavy projects where audit trails, approvals, and transmittals dominate.  

**Viewpoint / 4Projects**  
- Status: True CDE (when configured)  
- Strengths: State workflows; permissions by state; lifecycle tracking  
- Weaknesses: Needs configuration to align with ISO states  
- Scores: Capability 10.0 | UX 6 | Practical Effectiveness 8.4  
- Best used for: Building/construction projects with lots of subcontractors.  

**Autodesk Construction Cloud / BIM 360**  
- Status: CDE Simulation  
- Strengths: Can mimic WIP/Shared/Published/Archive; good metadata handling  
- Weaknesses: Permissions tied to folders, not state transitions  
- Scores: Capability 6.0 | UX 8 | Practical Effectiveness 6.8  
- Best used for: Autodesk-native projects (Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks).  

**Trimble Connect**  
- Status: Partial CDE  
- Strengths: Good model coordination; tagging; versioning  
- Weaknesses: Weak state control and approvals  
- Scores: Capability 6.0 | UX 7 | Practical Effectiveness 6.4  
- Best used for: Model coordination and small-to-mid projects.  

**SharePoint**  
- Status: EDMS  
- Strengths: Versioning; permissions; metadata (for docs)  
- Weaknesses: No native state transitions without heavy customisation  
- Scores: Capability 3.0 | UX 5 | Practical Effectiveness 3.8  
- Best used for: Document management in Microsoft 365; often paired with PW for co-authoring.  

**Dropbox / Box / Google Drive**  
- Status: EDMS  
- Strengths: Easy file sharing; simple permissions; intuitive UX  
- Weaknesses: No state workflows or compliance-grade approvals  
- Scores: Capability 1.0 | UX 8 | Practical Effectiveness 3.8  
- Best used for: Quick-and-dirty file sharing, small teams, or non-ISO projects.

### Disclaimer (and a bit of irony)
Yes — I used ChatGPT to help shape this article. Before you roll your eyes, here’s the reality:

- We’ve spent over 6 hours of back-and-forth conversation building and refining this piece.  
- We went through 30+ iterations of content.  
- I asked it to regenerate the full draft 3 times.  
- We explored 8+ different angles — definitions, scoring, optimism bias, UI/UX, single vs federated, pros/cons, decision matrix, usage guidance.  
- If I’d done this solo, it would have been 12–15 hours of effort.  
- And at every step, I anchored it with my own 15 years of ProjectWise admin experience and 25 years in the construction industry.  

The irony isn’t lost on me — I’m calling out AI-driven noise on LinkedIn while using AI to produce this. But here’s the difference:

Don’t use AI blindly. Use it as a partner or assistant — like dictating ideas to a colleague, or having someone help with the legwork. Let it research, challenge, and ask questions, but don’t trust the outputs fully. Always test, refine, and overlay your own real-world experience.
