# CDE vs EDMS – They’re Not the Same Thing (And Yes, It Matters)

I’ve seen a lot of posts on LinkedIn lately about *CDE this* and *CDE that* — and honestly, a fair few of them read like they were generated by an AI chatbot for someone who’s never actually worked in one.
It’s all very polished, very confident… and in some cases, very wrong.

More recently, I was asked if I could help explain what a CDE is and provide some training for a team that was struggling with the concept. I couldn’t take that on directly, but it struck me that the challenge isn’t unique — a lot of people in our industry are still unclear on what a CDE actually is, how it differs from an EDMS, and when each should be used.

So I thought I’d do the next best thing: write this article to share my thoughts and experience — hopefully offering some clarity, guidance, and maybe a reality check or two.

### TL;DR / Executive Summary
- All CDEs are EDMSs — but not all EDMSs are CDEs  
- A true CDE must follow ISO 19650 principles: information states, controlled workflows, metadata, and access tied to state  
- ProjectWise, Aconex, and Viewpoint/4Projects are CDE-capable — but only when configured correctly  
- ACC/BIM 360 and Trimble Connect can simulate/partially support CDEs, but lack true state-based controls  
- SharePoint, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box = EDMS only  
- UI/UX matters — a perfect CDE nobody likes using will be bypassed, while a user-friendly EDMS might be used properly every day  
- Choose EDMS when compliance isn’t critical; choose a configured CDE when scale, risk, or contracts demand it

### My Story
I’ve spent 25 years in the construction industry, and the last 15 of those working with ProjectWise.

I started out as a Trainee Draftsman in a small surveying, architecture, and civil engineering business in my hometown. For those first eight years, I did a bit of everything — building surveys, boundary disputes, topo surveys, planning applications, building regs drawings, through to highways and drainage design for residential developments and small energy projects.

From there, I moved into the Highways Design Department of a consultancy, first as a CAD Technician, then becoming an Engineer and eventually stepping into the world of Digital Engineering and Information Management.

That journey has exposed me to a huge variety of systems, processes, people, and ways of working — from small, local projects to large-scale infrastructure programmes.

Over that time, I’ve seen:
- True CDEs doing exactly what ISO 19650 intended  
- EDMSs pretending to be CDEs with clever folder gymnastics  
- And “solutions” that were just shiny shared drives in disguise  

This isn’t theory — it’s from the trenches. And yes, I’m very much in the PW camp.

### What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

### What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

| Platform | CDE Status | Where It Passes | Where It Fails | Capability Score | UI/UX Score | Practical Effectiveness | Best Used For |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Bentley ProjectWise | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; metadata-driven access; robust audit trail | Without config, just a high-end EDMS | 10.0 | 4 | 7.6 | Complex infra projects; lifecycle traceability; integrates with engineering tools; often paired with SharePoint/OneDrive |
| Aconex | True CDE (when configured) | Workflow-driven state changes; role-based access; compliance reporting | Without config, workflows become glorified transmittals | 10.0 | 5 | 8.0 | Contract-heavy projects where audit trails dominate |
| Viewpoint / 4Projects | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; permissions by state; lifecycle tracking | Needs configuring for ISO states | 10.0 | 6 | 8.4 | Building/construction projects with subcontractors |
| Autodesk Construction Cloud / BIM 360 | CDE Simulation | Can mimic WIP/Shared/Published/Archive | Permissions tied to folders | 6.0 | 8 | 6.8 | Autodesk-native projects (Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks) |
| Trimble Connect | Partial CDE | Good model coordination; tagging; versioning | Weak state control and approvals | 6.0 | 7 | 6.4 | Model coordination; small-to-mid projects |
| SharePoint | EDMS | Versioning; permissions; metadata | No native state transitions | 3.0 | 5 | 3.8 | Document management; Microsoft 365 handover repositories |
| Dropbox / Box / Google Drive | EDMS | Easy sharing; simple permissions | No state workflows | 1.0 | 8 | 3.8 | Quick file sharing; small teams |
