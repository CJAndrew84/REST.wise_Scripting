# CDE vs EDMS – They’re Not the Same Thing (And Yes, It Matters)

Let’s start with the basics.

**EDMS** = Electronic Document Management System — a system for storing, versioning, and controlling access to electronic documents.

**CDE** = Common Data Environment — an EDMS that’s been extended and configured (per ISO 19650) to manage the state, workflow, and lifecycle of project information across all parties.

## Introduction 
I’ve seen a lot of posts on LinkedIn lately about *CDE this* and *CDE that* — and honestly, a fair few of them read like they were generated by an AI chatbot for someone who’s never actually worked in one.
It’s all very polished, very confident… and in some cases, very wrong.

More recently, I was asked if I could help explain what a CDE is and provide some training for a team that was struggling with the concept. I couldn’t take that on directly, but it struck me that the challenge isn’t unique — a lot of people in our industry are still unclear on what a CDE actually is, how it differs from an EDMS, and when each should be used.

So I thought I’d do the next best thing: write this article to share my thoughts and experience — hopefully offering some clarity, guidance, and maybe a reality check or two.

### TL;DR / Executive Summary
- All CDEs are EDMSs — but not all EDMSs are CDEs  
- A true CDE must follow ISO 19650 principles: information states, controlled workflows, metadata, and access tied to state  
- ProjectWise, Aconex, and Viewpoint/4Projects are CDE-capable — but only when configured correctly  
- ACC/BIM 360 and Trimble Connect can simulate/partially support CDEs, but lack true state-based controls  
- SharePoint, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box = EDMS only  
- UI/UX matters — a perfect CDE nobody likes using will be bypassed, while a user-friendly EDMS might be used properly every day  
- Choose EDMS when compliance isn’t critical; choose a configured CDE when scale, risk, or contracts demand it

### My Story — Why I Think I Can Provide Insight into CDEs vs EDMS

I’ve spent 25 years in the construction industry, and the last 15 of those working with ProjectWise.

I started out as a Trainee Draftsman in a small surveying, architecture, and civil engineering business in my hometown. For those first eight years, I did a bit of everything — building surveys, boundary disputes, topo surveys, planning applications, building regs drawings, through to highways and drainage design for residential developments and small energy projects.

From there, I moved into the Highways Design Department of a consultancy, first as a CAD Technician, then becoming an Engineer, and eventually stepping into the world of Digital Engineering and Information Management.

That journey has exposed me to a huge variety of systems, processes, people, and ways of working — from small, local projects to large-scale infrastructure programmes.

And over that time, I’ve seen it all:

True CDEs doing exactly what ISO 19650 intended

EDMSs pretending to be CDEs with clever folder gymnastics

And “solutions” that were just shiny shared drives in disguise

This isn’t theory — it’s lived experience from the trenches.
And yes, I’m very much in the ProjectWise camp — because when it’s configured right, it’s still the most rounded CDE on the market.

Single vs Federated CDEs

A common misconception is that a CDE is always one big platform where everything lives.
In reality, ISO 19650 allows for two models:

1. Single Repository CDE

One platform, all participants onboarded.

Pros:

Clean, simple governance

Everyone working in the same environment

Great for single-party projects or where the final handover is paper-based (booo)


Cons:

Expensive licensing if many external parties need access

Heavy onboarding burden (training, permissions, ongoing support)

Doesn’t always fit when different stakeholders already have entrenched systems


2. Federated / Connected Systems CDE

Different parties use different systems (design in ProjectWise, contractors in ACC, client on SharePoint).
As long as they’re linked with agreed rules, metadata standards, and state transitions, they collectively form the CDE.

Pros:

Lets each party use tools they already know (less training pain)

Flexible and scalable for complex, multi-organisation projects

Avoids forcing “one system to rule them all” when that’s not realistic

Easier to meet diverse client/contractor IT and security policies


Cons:

Governance overhead — you need clear rules on what lives where

Risk of EDMSs sneaking in and being mistaken for the CDE

Metadata and audit trails can get lost in transfers if rules aren’t tight

Higher chance of disputes if two systems claim to be the “single source of truth”


Using an EDMS inside a federated setup isn’t a problem, as long as its role is defined and the governance keeps states and auditability intact. The issue is only when the EDMS is treated as the CDE.

What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

Legend:

True CDE (when configured) = CDE-capable platforms that meet ISO 19650 with proper setup

CDE Simulation/Partial = Can mimic or partially support, but not fully ISO-compliant

EDMS only = Useful for storage and sharing, but not a CDE

### What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

| Platform | CDE Status | Where It Passes | Where It Fails | Capability Score | UI/UX Score | Practical Effectiveness | Best Used For |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Bentley ProjectWise | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; metadata-driven access; robust audit trail | Without config, just a high-end EDMS | 10.0 | 4 | 7.6 | Complex infra projects; lifecycle traceability; integrates with engineering tools; often paired with SharePoint/OneDrive |
| Aconex | True CDE (when configured) | Workflow-driven state changes; role-based access; compliance reporting | Without config, workflows become glorified transmittals | 10.0 | 5 | 8.0 | Contract-heavy projects where audit trails dominate |
| Viewpoint / 4Projects | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; permissions by state; lifecycle tracking | Needs configuring for ISO states | 10.0 | 6 | 8.4 | Building/construction projects with subcontractors |
| Autodesk Construction Cloud / BIM 360 | CDE Simulation | Can mimic WIP/Shared/Published/Archive | Permissions tied to folders | 6.0 | 8 | 6.8 | Autodesk-native projects (Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks) |
| Trimble Connect | Partial CDE | Good model coordination; tagging; versioning | Weak state control and approvals | 6.0 | 7 | 6.4 | Model coordination; small-to-mid projects |
| SharePoint | EDMS | Versioning; permissions; metadata | No native state transitions | 3.0 | 5 | 3.8 | Document management; Microsoft 365 handover repositories |
| Dropbox / Box / Google Drive | EDMS | Easy sharing; simple permissions | No state workflows | 1.0 | 8 | 3.8 | Quick file sharing; small teams |

A Note on Optimism Bias

Scoring “capability” assumes perfect configuration, governance, and adoption.
That’s rarely how projects run.

A platform can technically meet every ISO 19650 requirement — but if it’s clunky, hard to configure, or painful to use, people will bypass it.
That’s why I’ve added a Practical Effectiveness score — blending capability and UX — because the tool you can get people to use correctly will always outperform the “perfect” tool they avoid.

The UI/UX Factor Nobody Talks About

Here’s the dirty secret: some of the most compliant CDEs are clunky.
They tick every ISO box, but feel like they were designed during the Windows XP era.
If the UX fights the user, they’ll work around it — hello, shadow drives and email attachments.

Meanwhile, some EDMSs or “CDE-lite” tools have clean, modern, intuitive interfaces.
They don’t hit every ISO requirement, but teams actually use them (correctly) every day.
Sometimes, better UX delivers better real-world information management than the “perfect” CDE nobody likes using.

---

When is an EDMS Enough?

An EDMS might be fine if:

ISO 19650 compliance isn’t required

Your team is small and low-risk

You just need basic versioning and permissions

You’re in early design stages

When projects scale, disciplines multiply, or contracts require compliance — that’s when you move up to a true CDE.

---

The ACC / BIM 360 Debate

ACC/BIM 360 can act like a CDE if configured well. But permissions are folder-based, not state-based.
To restrict access, you move files between folders.

Purists say that’s a simulation, not a true CDE.
In a purist CDE:

State changes don’t involve moving the file

Lifecycle history stays intact

Tracking progression is clear — no “Where’s my file now?” games

---

So How Do You Choose?

It’s tempting to debate endlessly which platform is “the best CDE.” The truth is: they all have strengths and weaknesses.

ProjectWise – best all-rounder for infra, compliance, lifecycle.

ACC/BIM 360 – best for Autodesk-native workflows and easy adoption.

Aconex/Viewpoint – best when contracts, approvals, and transmittals dominate.

SharePoint – best for docs, handover, and client comfort.

Dropbox/Box/Drive – best for “quick and dirty” sharing when compliance isn’t even on the radar.


But here’s the ultimate reality check:
The best tool is usually the one you actually have access to.

If your client mandates SharePoint, you’ll use SharePoint. If your contractor insists on ACC, you’ll be in ACC. If your org is invested in ProjectWise, that’s where you’ll live.

The trick isn’t to chase the “perfect CDE.” It’s to understand what your tool can and can’t do — and then set up the right governance, workflows, and habits to close the gaps.

### Disclaimer (and a bit of irony)
Yes — I used ChatGPT to help shape this article. Before you roll your eyes, here’s the reality:

- We’ve spent over 6 hours of back-and-forth conversation building and refining this piece.  
- We went through 30+ iterations of content.  
- I asked it to regenerate the full draft 3 times.  
- We explored 8+ different angles — definitions, scoring, optimism bias, UI/UX, single vs federated, pros/cons, decision matrix, usage guidance.  
- If I’d done this solo, it would have been 12–15 hours of effort. But the actual effort, 150+ Turns over multiple weeks, approximately 6-8 hours of my time.
- And at every step, I anchored it with my own 15 years of ProjectWise admin experience and 25 years in the construction industry.  

The irony isn’t lost on me — I’m calling out AI-driven noise on LinkedIn while using AI to produce this. But here’s the difference:

Don’t use AI blindly. Use it as a partner or assistant — like dictating ideas to a colleague, or having someone help with the legwork. Let it research, challenge, and ask questions, but don’t trust the outputs fully. Always test, refine, and overlay your own real-world experience.
