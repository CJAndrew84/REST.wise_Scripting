# CDE vs EDMS – They’re Not the Same Thing (And Yes, It Matters)

(... same intro and sections as LinkedIn version ...)

### What’s Out There — and Who Passes the “True CDE” Test?

| Platform | CDE Status | Where It Passes | Where It Fails | Capability Score | UI/UX Score | Practical Effectiveness | Best Used For |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Bentley ProjectWise | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; metadata-driven access; robust audit trail | Without config, just a high-end EDMS | 10.0 | 4 | 7.6 | Complex infra projects; lifecycle traceability; integrates with engineering tools; often paired with SharePoint/OneDrive |
| Aconex | True CDE (when configured) | Workflow-driven state changes; role-based access; compliance reporting | Without config, workflows become glorified transmittals | 10.0 | 5 | 8.0 | Contract-heavy projects where audit trails dominate |
| Viewpoint / 4Projects | True CDE (when configured) | State workflows; permissions by state; lifecycle tracking | Needs configuring for ISO states | 10.0 | 6 | 8.4 | Building/construction projects with subcontractors |
| Autodesk Construction Cloud / BIM 360 | CDE Simulation | Can mimic WIP/Shared/Published/Archive | Permissions tied to folders | 6.0 | 8 | 6.8 | Autodesk-native projects (Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks) |
| Trimble Connect | Partial CDE | Good model coordination; tagging; versioning | Weak state control and approvals | 6.0 | 7 | 6.4 | Model coordination; small-to-mid projects |
| SharePoint | EDMS | Versioning; permissions; metadata | No native state transitions | 3.0 | 5 | 3.8 | Document management; Microsoft 365 handover repositories |
| Dropbox / Box / Google Drive | EDMS | Easy sharing; simple permissions | No state workflows | 1.0 | 8 | 3.8 | Quick file sharing; small teams |
